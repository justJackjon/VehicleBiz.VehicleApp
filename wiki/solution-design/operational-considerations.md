# Operational Considerations

## Operational Excellence Considerations for the Proposed Vehicle Data Management API

### **Introduction**

As any system matures and transitions from the development phase to production, there are several operational aspects to consider. The proposed system's operational efficiency hinges on an intricate balance of deployment strategies, proactive monitoring, routine maintenance, and robust support mechanisms. This page delves into these operational considerations, ensuring the system remains robust, responsive, and resilient.

### **Deployment Strategy**

#### **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

Embracing the CI/CD paradigm, the system will employ automated pipelines to ensure seamless code integration and deployment. Using GitHub Actions, the code will undergo rigorous unit and integration tests, static code analysis, and quality checks. Only after these quality gates are passed will the code be promoted to subsequent stages, culminating in a production deployment.

#### **Blue-Green Deployments**

In an enterprise solution scenario, Blue-Green deployments would be an optimal choice to ensure minimal downtime and facilitate a seamless user experience. This strategy involves having two separate environments: 'Blue' for the current live production and 'Green' for the new version. Once the new version is tested and ready for release, traffic is switched from the Blue environment to the Green, offering an almost instantaneous transition with a fallback option if issues emerge.

**However, for the proposed system architecture, Blue-Green deployments will not be implemented.** The primary reason for this is down to the decision to use a consumption-based App Service plan for the Azure Function App. This tier, while cost-effective, does not support deployment slots which would be the preferred method for implementing Blue-Green deployments. The decision to opt for a consumption-based plan was primarily driven by cost considerations, given that this application will serve as a demonstration piece only.

### **Monitoring & Logging**

#### **Application Insights**

To maintain a watchful eye on the system's health and performance, Application Insights will be utilised. This tool not only captures real-time telemetry but also offers insights into user behaviour, system dependencies, and performance bottlenecks. With Application Insights, anomalies can be detected early, potentially averting more significant issues further down the line.

#### **Logging Strategy**

Logs provide a chronological record of system events, critical for diagnostics and troubleshooting. The system will leverage structured logging, where logs are generated in a consistent format or structure, making them easier to analyse. These logs will be retained for a defined period, ensuring compliance with data retention policies and facilitating historical analysis if needed.

### **Maintenance**

#### Reducing the Infrastructure Maintenance Burden

Given that the proposed system architecture leans heavily on Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings like Azure Function Apps, a significant amount of traditional maintenance tasks are abstracted away from us. PaaS solutions provided by Azure are inherently designed to manage and maintain the underlying infrastructure, including tasks like system patching, updates, and scaling. This allows developers to focus solely on the code and the business logic without the overhead of infrastructure management.

#### **Patching Vulnerable Dependencies**

Despite the benefits of PaaS outlined above, one essential maintenance task remains paramount: ensuring the security of the application code. Even within a PaaS environment, the application code and it's dependencies can become a potential vulnerability if not periodically reviewed and patched. As part of the maintenance strategy for this demonstration application, regular scans will be conducted by [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) to identify known vulnerabilities within the codebase. Thankfully, this perk comes for free when hosting repositories on GitHub, and was a key influence on deciding where to host the application code. Once vulnerabilities or malware has been identified, patches will be applied to mitigate these vulnerabilities in a timely fashion, ensuring that the application remains secure against known threats.

It's worth noting that while the system is designed as a demonstration piece, maintaining a secure codebase reflects best practices and showcases a commitment to security, even in a non-production environment.

### **Support & Troubleshooting**

Given that the proposed system is a demonstration piece, it does not implement a full-scale support and troubleshooting strategy. However, it's crucial to understand and acknowledge the importance of these mechanisms in an enterprise context.

For the purposes of this demo application:

* **Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation:** The system will include an interactive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI. This ensures that any developer or technical professional interacting with the system has clear guidelines on API endpoints, request/response formats, and overall functionality.
* **Codebase Monitoring:** While there isn't a dedicated support team, the application's health can be monitored using tools like Application Insights. This proactive approach aids in the identification of potential issues.
* **Feedback and Issue Reporting:** Given the demonstrative nature of the application, feedback and issue reporting can be streamlined through the project's GitHub repository. Users or developers can raise issues, which can then be addressed in subsequent code updates.

### **Summary**

While the proposed system is intended primarily a demonstration piece, it integrates best practices and principles that are crucial for operational efficiency in real-world, enterprise-grade solutions. By showcasing strategies in deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and support, the proposed system aims to serve as a testament to a well-architected cloud-native application. The operational considerations presented here intend to exhibit an understanding of the needs and challenges of a production environment, even if the actual system itself is designed for demonstrative purposes only.
