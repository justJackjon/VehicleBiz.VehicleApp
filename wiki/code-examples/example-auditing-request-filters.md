# Example 'Auditing' Request Filters

## Implementing Auditing Filters for Enhanced Traceability in Azure Functions

### **Introduction**

In addition to ensuring robustness through error handling and data validation, tracking the activities within the application provides essential transparency and traceability. Utilising filters for auditing purposes ensures a detailed log of critical operations, aiding in monitoring and potential troubleshooting.

### **Purpose**

The main role of the auditing filter is to log certain actions performed on the system. This ensures that there is a trace of who did what and when, which can be pivotal for understanding usage patterns, tracking changes, or investigating issues.

### **Example Implementation**

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System;

public class AuditingAttribute : FunctionInvocationFilterAttribute
{
    public override void OnExecuted(FunctionExecutedContext context)
    {
        var request = context.Arguments["req"] as HttpRequestData;
        var logger = context.Logger;

        if (request is null)
        {
            logger.LogError("Failed to audit because request data is missing.");
            return;
        }

        var requestData = request.ReadAsString();
        var user = request.Headers["User"]; // Assuming a user identifier in the headers

        logger.LogInformation($"User {user} performed an action. Data: {requestData}");
    }
}
```

This filter ensures that after a function is executed, an audit log is made, containing the user and the request data.

### **Integration**

To integrate this auditing mechanism into the functions, simply apply the `[Auditing]` attribute to the desired functions.

```csharp
[Function("UpdateVehicleFunction")]
[Auditing]
public HttpResponseData UpdateVehicle([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "put")] HttpRequestData req, FunctionContext executionContext)
{
    // Main function logic
}
```

By marking a function with the `[Auditing]` attribute, every execution will be logged with the necessary audit information.

### **Summary**

While data modification and other operations are pivotal in the application, maintaining a clear and traceable log of these operations is equally essential. By implementing an auditing filter, the application ensures that all significant actions are documented, thereby facilitating better monitoring, analysis, and potential issue investigation.
