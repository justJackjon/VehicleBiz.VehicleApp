# Example Exception Handling Middleware

## Centralised Exception Handling in Azure Functions Using Middleware

### Introduction

The middleware paradigm offers a powerful mechanism to intercept and handle requests globally. In the context of Azure Functions, this becomes indispensable for consistent and centralised error handling. Below, a basic approach has been outlined for constructing robust exception handling middleware.

### Purpose

The principal role of exception handling middleware is to catch and handle unhandled exceptions that emerge during the execution of our Azure Functions. This ensures that when an exception is raised, clients receive a consistent, user-friendly error response, while the system logs and potentially alerts developers about the specific error for further analysis.

### Example Implementation

```csharp
public class ErrorHandlingMiddleware : IFunctionsWorkerMiddleware
{
    public async Task Invoke(FunctionContext context, FunctionExecutionDelegate next)
    {
        try
        {
            await next(context);
        }
        catch (CustomException ex)
        {
            // Handle specific custom exception and return a specific status code or message
            context.Response = new HttpResponseData(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest)
            {
                StringBody = ex.Message
            };
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Handle generic exceptions
            context.Response = new HttpResponseData(HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError)
            {
                StringBody = "An unexpected error occurred."
            };
            
            // Log the exception for diagnostics
            context.Logger.LogError(ex, "An unexpected error occurred while processing the function.");
        }
    }
}
```

Here, any `CustomException` thrown within the Azure Functions is caught and processed to return a user-friendly error message. All other exceptions default to a generic error message. This distinction ensures that users aren't exposed to potentially sensitive or confusing system implementation details.

### Integration

To integrate this middleware into the Azure Functions runtime, register it as follows:

```csharp
var host = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults(workerApplication =>
    {
        workerApplication.UseMiddleware<ErrorHandlingMiddleware>();
    })
    .Build();
```

### Summary

Centralised error handling is essential for building a robust and dependable API. The outlined exception middleware provides a structured approach to manage errors, ensuring clients receive clear and consistent responses. By differentiating between custom and generic exceptions, we ensure users receive clear feedback without exposing underlying system details. As we continue to develop and iterate on our Azure Functions, this middleware serves as a foundational layer, enhancing the system's resilience and predictability.
